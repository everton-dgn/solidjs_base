# Lint

[Tooling reference](README.md)

## Project layout the preset expects

The rules match file paths relative to the folder where lint runs, so run it
from the application root. They know these locations:

| Path                                          | Meaning                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/`                                        | Application code. The `@/` alias points here             |
| `src/routes/`                                 | Pages. Each page may have a `seo.ts` module              |
| `src/components/{atoms,molecules,organisms}/` | UI layers                                                |
| `src/primitives/`                             | Shared primitives                                        |
| `src/infra/server/`                           | Backend adapters and server error handling               |
| `src/theme/`                                  | Global CSS                                               |
| `src/tests/pages/<Page>/`                     | End-to-end tests, one folder per page                    |
| `paraglide/`                                  | Generated i18n modules. The `@paraglide/` alias          |
| `tooling/`                                    | Project scripts and their tests, written for `node:test` |

An application with another layout can still use the preset, but it has to
override the rules that do not fit. See
[Changing the preset](#changing-the-preset).

## What the lint preset turns on

- Oxlint plugins: `import`, `jsx-a11y`, `node`, `oxc`, `promise`, `typescript`,
  `unicorn` and `vitest`.
- JavaScript plugins: `solid`, `vite-plus` and the three plugins of this package
  (`project`, `backend`, `architecture`), plus `paraglide` when
  `@inlang/paraglide-js` resolves from the folder where lint runs.
- Type-aware rules and type checking (`typeAware`, `typeCheck`).
- Warnings fail the run (`denyWarnings`), and an unused disable directive is an
  error.

Every rule is listed by name in the preset. No Oxlint category is enabled, so an
Oxlint update does not add rules on its own.

### Rules of this package

| Rule                                      | What it enforces                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `project/css-modules-import`              | A CSS Module is imported as the default binding `S`                                                                                                        |
| `project/css-filename`                    | A CSS file imported from `src/` is named `styles.module.css`, or `camelCase.css` inside `src/theme/`                                                       |
| `project/test-filename`                   | A test file sits in `__tests__` next to its module and is named after it, plus the environment: `Button/__tests__/Button.dom.test.tsx`                     |
| `project/no-export-list`                  | Exports sit on the declaration. `export { a, b }` is only allowed with `from`                                                                              |
| `project/seo-module`                      | A route `seo.ts` exports only `seo`. It has no relative value import, no value import from `src/routes/`, no computed `import()` and no `import.meta.glob` |
| `backend/static-solid-imports`            | No `import()` of `@solidjs/web` or its subpaths                                                                                                            |
| `backend/static-render-integrity-imports` | No `import()` of the `renderIntegrity` module                                                                                                              |
| `architecture/layer-imports`              | Lower layers do not import upper ones, and production code does not import tests or `tooling/`                                                             |

These rules read import specifiers as text. They resolve relative paths and the
`@/`, `@paraglide/` and `/src/` prefixes. An `import()` with a computed path and
any other alias are not checked, except in `seo.ts`, where a computed `import()`
is an error.

`architecture/layer-imports` checks these directions:

- The base layer (`src/@types`, `constants`, `helpers`, `data`, `infra`,
  `theme`, `i18n` and `paraglide/`) does not import primitives, components,
  routes or entry files.
- `src/primitives` does not import components, routes or entry files.
- Atoms do not import molecules or organisms, and molecules do not import
  organisms.
- No production file imports a test or `tooling/`.

The entry files are `App`, `Document`, `entry-server`, `entry-client`, `router`
and `middleware`, at the root of `src/`.

`project/test-filename` accepts these names:

- `Name.<environment>.test.ts(x)` in `src/`, where the environment is `node`,
  `dom`, `browser` or `e2e`.
- `Name.test-d.ts(x)` in `src/`, for type tests.
- `Name.test.ts` in `tooling/`.

`Name` is the folder that holds `__tests__`. A qualifier may follow it:
`Button.focus.dom.test.tsx`. End-to-end tests are the exception: they live in
`src/tests/pages/<Page>/` and are named after the page.

### Backend restrictions

Inside `src/`, the preset also restricts what code can reach:

- `console` is not allowed. `src/infra/server/logServerFailure/index.ts` is the
  only module that may call `console.error`.
- `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, `WebSocket` and `EventSource` are not allowed.
  `src/infra/server/requestJson/index.ts` is the only module that may call
  `fetch`.
- The Node transports (`http`, `https`, `http2`, `net`, `tls`, `undici`) cannot
  be imported.
- `markSafeError` and `SAFE_ERROR` can only be imported in
  `src/infra/server/publicErrors/index.ts`.
- `configureServerErrors` from `@solidjs/web`, the
  `@solidjs/web/server-functions` subpath and `observeRenderFailures` from the
  application's `renderIntegrity` module can only be imported in
  `src/infra/server/configureServerErrors/index.ts`.
- A relative import goes up at most three levels. Use `@/` beyond that.

Test files and `.d.ts` files are exempt from all of these except the relative
import limit.

## Changing the preset

`lint` and `fmt` are plain objects. Spread them and replace what the application
needs:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { fmt } from '@evertondgn/solid-tooling/fmt'
import { lint } from '@evertondgn/solid-tooling/lint'
import { defineConfig } from 'vite-plus'

export default defineConfig({
  fmt,
  lint: {
    ...lint,
    ignorePatterns: [...(lint.ignorePatterns ?? []), 'generated/**'],
    rules: { ...lint.rules, 'eslint/max-params': 'off' }
  }
})
```

Do not replace `lint.jsPlugins`. It registers the JavaScript plugins listed
above, and a rule whose plugin is missing from it fails to resolve.

To turn a rule off for some files only, add an entry to `lint.overrides` and
keep the existing ones:

```ts
overrides: [
  ...(lint.overrides ?? []),
  {
    files: ['src/tests/pages/Checkout/**'],
    rules: { 'project/test-filename': 'off' }
  }
]
```
