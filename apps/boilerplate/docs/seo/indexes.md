# Editorial indexes, endpoints and cache

## Selection for llms.txt

`llms.txt` collects the same metadata from the manifest, without rendering pages
or running preloads, and publishes only the pages that declare
`route.info.llms`. The file is a curated index for language models. The format
sets no size limit. This project publishes the index as a file in the build and
applies an operating budget of 1 MiB, configurable through `seo.llms.maxBytes`
in `vite.config.ts`. Going over it stops the build, without truncating the
content. On large sites, measure the real texts, select the pages that explain
the product and group them. `llms: true` includes the page; without an inherited
section, it goes to the default `Pages` section. `{ section: 'Guides' }` creates
or reuses a section with that name, in the order in which it appears in the
manifest; `{ optional: true }` moves the page to the `Optional` section, which
the format reserves for content the model may skip, and a section declared with
that name merges into it. The setting is inherited along the route chain: a
layout with `llms: { section: 'Docs' }` includes its children in that section, a
child can leave with `llms: false` or override only the field it declares, and
`llms: true` in a child turns the inclusion back on, keeping the inherited
section and optional mark. `noindex: true` excludes the page from the sitemap
and from llms.txt, even with the flag. The filter looks at the effective setting
of the page, including inheritance and the child index route. The resolver is
colocated in `packages/solid-runtime/src/seo/llms/helpers/resolveRouteLlms/`.
The index is in the base locale. Routes with a parameter stay out even with
`llms`, and the sources of `route.info.sitemap` do not feed this index. Markdown
publication is controlled separately by `seo.markdown` and
`route.info.markdown`; when enabled and the leaf declares `markdown: true` or
`'dynamic'`, the index link points to the `.md` (`/en/about.md`), and for the
others, to the HTML.

## Endpoints and cache

`sitemap.xml/`, `robots.txt/` and `llms.txt/` are API routes (`index.ts`). The
sitemap lists the static pages of the route manifest, without the 404 fallback
and without `noindex`, with `<lastmod>` on the `article` pages (the same date as
the JSON-LD, `dateModified` or `datePublished`), plus the entries of the
`route.info.sitemap` sources. llms.txt publishes, in Markdown, the notes in
`llms.txt/constants.ts` (facts the agent needs to know before opening the links:
locale, what the site offers, what does not exist) and then the title and
description of the pages selected by `route.info.llms`, grouped by section. The
use cases of `LLMS_USE_CASES` open the `When to use` section, with links and
descriptions that guide the reading of the home page and of the page about the
project. Rewrite the notes and the use cases in each derived project.
`Document.tsx` announces this file on every page with
`<link rel="describedby" href="/llms.txt">`, the discovery that the llms.txt
spec recommends; agents are not redirected. robots uses a one-line re-export of
the runtime route. Its factory publishes `*` with `Allow: /` and a `Disallow` of
the server function endpoint (`/_server` by default, read from the plugin's
`virtual:solid-server-function-handler`), followed by the AI training groups and
sitemap path configured in `src/constants/site/robots.ts`. The preset receives
these serializable values in `seo.robots`; the sitemap binding uses
`seo.sitemap: { static: true }` for static headers and artifact generation.
Omitting `sitemapPaths` omits all `Sitemap:` lines. Search engines and agents
that read pages at the user's request stay allowed, because they are the
audience of llms.txt. `Disallow` is a request that badly behaved robots ignore,
and it does not remove a URL from the index; for that, use `noindex` in
`route.info.seo`. In production the process keeps the robots response in memory.
llms.txt and the static parts of the sitemap are build files, and the dynamic
sitemap reuses the manifest. The dynamic sources are read per endpoint: the
index lists the parts, and each part reads its own batch. llms.txt uses
`i18n/locale-context`: execution is direct without an i18n project, and
otherwise inside the Paraglide context of the base locale (the runtime
`baseLocale`), including the site description and the page metadata, so that the
context of another locale does not change the text. The note about the locale of
the index derives from the same `baseLocale`, with the locale name in English,
the language of the notes. The list of locales in the same note comes from
`locales`, with the base locale first, the English name and the path of each
locale: it follows `project.inlang/settings.json` without manual edits.
Successful responses of robots and of the dynamic sitemap go out with
`public, max-age=0, s-maxage=3600, stale-if-error=86400` in production (the CDN
reuses them for one hour; Vercel only caches a function response with `s-maxage`
and consumes `s-maxage` and `stale-if-error` without passing them to the
browser) and with `no-store` in development. With `stale-if-error`, a function
error after the copy expires can reuse an earlier copy, according to the hosting
contract. The static files use the cache policy of the platform; they do not get
the CSP or the cache of the middleware. The absolute URLs of the three files
start from the origin of `VITE_SITE_URL`; a site served under a subpath is not
supported by this generation. The 404 page declares `robots: noindex`. The
social image is `public/images/og.png`, with an immutable one-year cache set in
the `publicAssets` of `/images/` in `vite.config.ts`. Because that cache does
not revalidate, publish a new image under another name (for example,
`og-2026-10.png`) and update `SITE.image.path`: overwriting `og.png` leaves
browsers and intermediate caches with the old version for up to a year. The
JSON-LD logo reuses `public/favicon/apple-touch-icon.png`.
